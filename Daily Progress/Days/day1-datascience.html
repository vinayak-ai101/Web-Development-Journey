    <h1>Data Science</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </i></p>
    <p><strong>Data Science</strong> is an interdisciplinary academic field<sup>[1]</sup> that uses <mark> statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.</mark><sup>[2]</sup>
        <br> <br>
    Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).<sup>[3] </sup>Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.<sup>[4]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.<sup>[5]</sup> It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.<sup>[6]</sup> However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.<sup>[7][8]</sup>
        <br> <br>
        A <b>data scientist </b>is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.<sup>[9]</sup>
